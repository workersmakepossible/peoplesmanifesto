                            <p>We want the People’s Manifesto to hold up a mirror to all of us - to reflect the lives of everyone who calls Singapore home. When you look at it, you should see your pain, your struggles, your values, hopes and dreams. If you don’t, then we hope you will help us shine the mirror till it does!</p>
                            <p>We’re launching the People’s Manifesto at a public townhall on 3 August, from 2-5pm (venue TBC), where you can come and share your views on these vital issues that affect all our lives, and debate the ideas put forward in the Manifesto. So save the date, and make sure your voice is heard! Members of all political parties will be invited to come and listen to the people’s discussion, and learn from us</p>

                            To (Re)Build A Democratic Society
                        </a>
                    </p>
    
                    <p>For any society to truly flourish, it is important that the people are empowered to participate freely and safely in public discourse and politics, and shape policies at macro and micro levels through exercising their civil and political rights. Politics has a powerful impact on every aspect of our lives, and we have both a right and a responsibility to speak up about injustice, organise ourselves and take collective action to improve our lives and that of our fellow people.  
                    </p>
    
                    <p>Dissent and contestation are healthy, generative features of a democracy. No single person, group, or political party has a monopoly on wisdom about how a country should be run. Far from the stereotype of the politically apathetic Singaporean, it is evident in all kinds of spaces, from social media, coffee shops, taxi rides, to elections and Speakers’ Corner rallies that people of all backgrounds care deeply about how the country is run, and have well-formed opinions on changes they want to see. With increasingly complex social, economic and geopolitical realities to navigate, it is critical that Singapore has a vibrant democracy that encourages its people to be active citizens without fear of sanction. </p>

                    </p>
    
                    <p>No one in Singapore should struggle to put food on the table or afford other essential goods and services, regardless of income or employment status. Everyone should be able to participate fully in society and feel included, which requires keeping inequality to a minimum. The government should ensure that the needs of children, the elderly, ill and disabled can be met through public assistance programmes that are rights-based, without overburdening families or relying on philanthropy and charity. 
                    </p>

                    </p>
    
                    <p>Labour policy should ensure that all workers and their families have the opportunity to thrive in Singapore, have safe and decent working conditions, and are equitably compensated for the wealth they generate for the country.  
                    </p>
    
                    <p>Overall, the rights of workers have been eroded over the decades, and the gains of the labour movement of the 50s and 60s have been clawed back slowly but surely. These need to be reinstated, and improved to reflect the needs of modern workers.

                    <p>Everyone who calls Singapore home should have a right to safe, stable and affordable housing, which is becoming increasingly out of reach, and pushing residents into unconscionable debt. Our public housing system should cater to all long-term residents, regardless of marital status, race, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, or citizenship. Those who are unhoused need much more comprehensive and accessible support. The construction of public housing should not require the exploitation of migrant labour, and migrant workers should be guaranteed decent accommodation while working in Singapore, where they are free from surveillance and movement restrictions. </p>

No one chooses to be ill and so, no one should face financial ruin when attempting to receive the healthcare they need. Relatedly, for patients to receive the care they deserve, healthcare workers need to have safe, humane working conditions. To this end, urgent reforms are needed to ensure that both patients’ and healthcare workers’ basic needs are met. </p>

                        </a>
                    </p>
    
                    <p>The right to retire means that one should be able to stop working at a reasonable age and still be able to continue meeting their needs independently (i.e. without reliance on family members or charities), and without too significant a drop in their standard of living. Our late years are a time when most of us become more frail, and we should be entitled to rest, living out the rest of our lives peacefully, and with dignity. Our older people should not have to hustle, collect cardboard or engage in rag-picking for a pittance, clear plates at coffee shops, or panhandle on the streets.</p>
    
                    <p>The government’s focus on contributory pensions and stringent, means-tested welfare for older persons leaves a significant number of people in Singapore unable to afford retirement. This affects especially the very old who did not have significant educational opportunities in the early years, and have not had the chance to accumulate sufficient funds in their CPF. With the rising cost of living, many younger workers too are nervous that they will never be able to stop working. Retirement is increasingly becoming a privilege of the wealthy, rather than the right of all. Singapore’s retirement policies must be reformed to ensure that older persons can experience financial security regardless of the income they earned and saved during their working years.</p>

                    <p>The climate crisis is a multi-faceted crisis that will affect all sectors of society. Importantly, we must recognise that those who have contributed the least to the climate crisis are usually the ones who are affected the most. A transition away from our carbon-dependent paradigm is urgently needed but any climate mitigation and adaptation plans must be embedded with a justice lens: who will pay for the climate crisis and how are we protecting underserved, underrepresented, marginalised communities?</p>

                <p>Political parties will soon be releasing their party manifestos, with promises of what they will push for if they are elected into Parliament. Their campaigns will focus on winning voters by persuading us of their vision for Singapore, and the policies that they think are best for us. <b>Ahead of that, what if we, the people, come together and tell them what WE think the most urgent issues are, and what changes matter most to us?</b> </p>
     
                <p>What if we take charge of our futures by demanding that political parties that aspire to form government listen to us, and truly represent us? </p>
     
                <p><b>Healthcare workers, students, community organisers, researchers, social workers, writers, artists, environmentalists</b> and others have come together to pen a People’s Manifesto which highlights the key reforms we believe are the most urgent for a more socially and economically just Singapore which neglects no one, and where all our diverse communities can thrive. </p>
     
                <p>The People’s Manifesto puts forward exciting and practical ideas for how we can rebuild a democratic society, arrest the rising cost of living, improve working conditions for all workers, make housing and healthcare affordable and accessible to all, ensure retirement adequacy, and tackle the climate crisis. </p>
     
                <p><b>These ideas come from the lived experience and wisdom of ordinary people, and are validated by rigorous research by practitioners in each area.</b></p>

                    </p>
    
                    <p>For any society to truly flourish, it is important that the people are empowered to participate freely and safely in public discourse and politics, and shape policies at macro and micro levels through exercising their civil and political rights. Politics has a powerful impact on every aspect of our lives, and we have both a right and a responsibility to speak up about injustice, organise ourselves and take collective action to improve our lives and that of our fellow people.  
                    </p>
    
                    <p>Dissent and contestation are healthy, generative features of a democracy. No single person, group, or political party has a monopoly on wisdom about how a country should be run. Far from the stereotype of the politically apathetic Singaporean, it is evident in all kinds of spaces, from social media, coffee shops, taxi rides, to elections and Speakers’ Corner rallies that people of all backgrounds care deeply about how the country is run, and have well-formed opinions on changes they want to see. With increasingly complex social, economic and geopolitical realities to navigate, it is critical that Singapore has a vibrant democracy that encourages its people to be active citizens without fear of sanction. </p>

                    <p>No one in Singapore should struggle to put food on the table or afford other essential goods and services, regardless of income or employment status. Everyone should be able to participate fully in society and feel included, which requires keeping inequality to a minimum. The government should ensure that the needs of children, the elderly, ill and disabled can be met through public assistance programmes that are rights-based, without overburdening families or relying on philanthropy and charity. 
                    </p>
    
                    <p>Caregivers’ contribution to society should be valued for its indispensable lifesaving and life-nourishing role, and caregivers should not be forced into precarity or made to compromise on the care they provide at home to earn income through the workforce.</p>

                    <p>Everyone who calls Singapore home should have a right to safe, stable and affordable housing, which is becoming increasingly out of reach, and pushing residents into unconscionable debt. Our public housing system should cater to all long-term residents, regardless of marital status, race, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, or citizenship. Those who are unhoused need much more comprehensive and accessible support. The construction of public housing should not require the exploitation of migrant labour, and migrant workers should be guaranteed decent accommodation while working in Singapore, where they are free from surveillance and movement restrictions. </p>

No one chooses to be ill and so, no one should face financial ruin when attempting to receive the healthcare they need. Relatedly, for patients to receive the care they deserve, healthcare workers need to have safe, humane working conditions. To this end, urgent reforms are needed to ensure that both patients’ and healthcare workers’ basic needs are met. </p>

                    </p>
    
                    <p>The right to retire means that one should be able to stop working at a reasonable age and still be able to continue meeting their needs independently (i.e. without reliance on family members or charities), and without too significant a drop in their standard of living. Our late years are a time when most of us become more frail, and we should be entitled to rest, living out the rest of our lives peacefully, and with dignity. Our older people should not have to hustle, collect cardboard or engage in rag-picking for a pittance, clear plates at coffee shops, or panhandle on the streets.</p>
    
                    <p>The government’s focus on contributory pensions and stringent, means-tested welfare for older persons leaves a significant number of people in Singapore unable to afford retirement. This affects especially the very old who did not have significant educational opportunities in the early years, and have not had the chance to accumulate sufficient funds in their CPF. With the rising cost of living, many younger workers too are nervous that they will never be able to stop working. Retirement is increasingly becoming a privilege of the wealthy, rather than the right of all. Singapore’s retirement policies must be reformed to ensure that older persons can experience financial security regardless of the income they earned and saved during their working years.</p>

                    <p>The climate crisis is a multi-faceted crisis that will affect all sectors of society. Importantly, we must recognise that those who have contributed the least to the climate crisis are usually the ones who are affected the most. A transition away from our carbon-dependent paradigm is urgently needed but any climate mitigation and adaptation plans must be embedded with a justice lens: who will pay for the climate crisis and how are we protecting underserved, underrepresented, marginalised communities?</p>
