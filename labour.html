                                Labour policy should ensure that all workers and their families have the opportunity to thrive in Singapore, have safe and decent working conditions, and are equitably compensated for the wealth they generate for the country.<br><br>
                                
                                Singapore’s impressive US$2 trillion economy is only possible because of the many local and non-local workers who labour day and night in this city. However, despite their hard work, Singapore workers’ quality of life has been on the decline. Workers’ share of the country’s wealth has decreased over the years.<br><br>

                                Overall, the rights of workers have been eroded over the decades, and the gains of the labour movement of the 50s and 60s have been clawed back slowly but surely. These need to be reinstated and updated to reflect the needs of modern workers.

                                        <p>In 2019, workers only received 40 cents for every dollar generated in the country, a 2 cent decrease from their share in 2014. This means that in contrast, capital’s share of wealth has increased from 58 cents to 60 cents per dollar generated. While workers’ incomes may have increased in absolute terms, this is no match for the rising costs. 40% of Singaporeans’ incomes are not keeping up with inflation. For young workers and students soon to enter the workforce, the rising cost of living ranks as the top concern for their mental health. Without cost-of-living adjustments to wages, workers face increasing insecurity and feel like they have no choice but to work more, take on side hustles or forgo a decent standard of living. This is unsustainable and unjust.</p>

Although workers can legally join an existing union or form one if it does not currently exist to seek redressal, many workers feel cynical about unions protecting their interests. This is because NTUC (National Trade Union Congress), the umbrella body representing more than 90% of unions in the country is led by members of the ruling party and government, and NTUC’s tripartite system may be seen by many to disadvantage workers’ interests as two of the three tripartite partners are non-workers. Only a handful of unions are independent of government control, and the process of registering independent unions remains onerous and obfuscated.</p>

These workers do not receive any support measures the government usually provides for cost-of-living adjustments or GST increases.  Many of these migrant workers pay income tax, and all pay GST, but they have no rights in return.</p>
