                                Everyone who calls Singapore home should have a right to safe, stable, and affordable housing, which is becoming increasingly out of reach, and pushing residents into unconscionable debt. Our public housing system should cater to all long-term residents, regardless of marital status, race, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, or citizenship. Those who are unhoused need much more comprehensive and accessible support. The construction of public housing should not require the exploitation of migrant labour, and migrant workers should be guaranteed decent accommodation, where they are free from surveillance and movement restrictions.

                                        <p>One significant reason why housing has become unaffordable is that reselling one’s HDB flat has occupied the role of retirement financing in the absence of a nationalised pension scheme that provides retirement income at sufficient replacement rates. Secondly, high land cost often makes up the lion’s share (about 60%) of development costs for Built-to-Order housing. However, how the government arrives at this land price is frustratingly opaque. If housing can be affordable for all, the positive effects spill over into society when people experience safety and stability as a result of being able to access affordable housing.</p>

                                        <p>The Singapore government often touts a high rate of home ownership as a result of sound policies in the public housing system. However, this obscures the fact that the regulations surrounding access to housing systemically exclude vulnerable members of the community, notably non-citizen single parents of Singaporean / PR children, unwed singles below the age of 35 (which include LGBTQ+ couples, since same-sex marriage is illegal in Singapore) and single parents below the age of 21.</p>

                                        <p>The government purports that the EIP exists to promote racial integration and prevent the formation of racial enclaves. However, given the country’s racial demographic, the EIP only prevents the clustering of ethnic minority households while cementing the clustering of Chinese households, ensuring that all neighbourhoods have a majority of Chinese households. The EIP is therefore discriminatory against ethnic minorities. While individuals can file an appeal against the EIP, most appeals have not been successful. In 2022, it was reported that 66% of appeals against the EIP failed. </p>

                                        <p>Currently, in order to keep construction costs low, the government provides building contracts to private construction companies via a bidding system. Bidding drives contractors to keep costs unsustainably low in order to remain competitive, sometimes reducing costs below the actual cost of inputs.</p>

                                        <p>The main area where contractors can make cuts to costs below the actual value of the input is in labour, which is where most exploitation of migrant labour occurs. This results in many dehumanising conditions that migrant workers are subject to, such as rampant wage theft, overwork, inedible food, and unsafe working conditions.</p>
